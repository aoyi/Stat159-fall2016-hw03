# UC Berkeley Statistics 159 Fall 2016 Homework 3

## Introduction

In this homework, our objective is to reproduce the multiple regression analysis introduced in Chapter 3, Linear Regression, from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Deniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. To replicate the result, we mainly apply computational toolkit in r such as lm and summary function and combine them with key elements for reproducible work such as makefile and git. The requirement for this project can be found at https://github.com/ucb-stat159/stat159-fall-2016/blob/master/hws/hw03/stat159-hw03-multiple-regression.pdf.
