# Data README

This data folder contains four files. 

`Advertising.csv` is our original data set on which the linear model is applied. The data file can be downloaded at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv, credited to Gareth James, Deniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

`eda-output.txt` is the file that contains all the summary statistics of TV, newspaper, radio, sales and the correlation matrix. It is saved via `sink()` by running the `code/scripts/eda-script.R` file. 

`regression.RData` includes the regression objects we obtained by running the linear and multiple regression model in binary format. This file is produced via `save()` from the `code/scripts/regression-script.R` file. 

`correlation-matrix.RData` includes the correlation matrix between all variables in binary format. It is produced via `save()` from the `code/scripts/eda-script.R` file.
